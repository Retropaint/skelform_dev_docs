# Introduction

SkelForm is a 2D skeletal animation editor, designed primarily for games.

These animations require a runtime, ie., a library/framework that processes and
renders them.

SkelForm, as well as this documentation, are works in progress.

## Pseudo Code

Throughout this documentation will be pseudo-code blocks. It mostly follows
[Golang](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), but will bend the syntax and rules
occasionally for simplicity.
